# I used HTML, CSS and some JS for the side navigation.
It's 100% responsive in all devices sizes, I used CSS grid, flexbox to acieve this.

Was it easy? => yes, but I learned new stuff like how I could do the side nav from skratch.
I'm currently still learning JS and looking forward for new projects.
